## Introduction

This document illustrates the release planning strategy for the Re3gistry software, including all its components (Re3gistry and RoR). The document explains the rationale behind the plan and details the foreseen release dates throughout the year together with their main expected changes. It also lists a number of resources for users to get informed on the future expected changes (future releases) in the Re3gistry and to check in detail the content of each released version (past releases).

## Objective and Summary

The objective of this document is to explain the release planning process for the Re3gistry in an open, clear and transparent way to the community in order to ensure that stable validation criteria are provided and communicated efficiently. The release plan is beneficial to the whole community.

The core of the release plan is **the annual major release** of the Re3gistry software. This release includes all the fixed issues and complete developments until that date. Each year the major release of the Re3gistry software is published two months in advance of the release of the Register Federation Tool (RoR).

In addition to this major release, every year **a number of minor releases** are also published (in January, March and September).

Expected releses

R3gistry software:

- Major releases: September 2022, September 2023, September 2024
- Minor releases every three months between major releases. December, March, June.

Register Federation Tool (RoR):

- Major releases: November 2022, November 2023, November 2024
- Minor releases every three months between major releases. February, May, August.


In particular, all the **_breaking changes_** (changed that imply importants modifications in the application) are only included in the major versions, while the **_non-breaking changes_** are included in any version (major or minor). In addition, **_hotfixes_** (i.e. fixes to major bugs or faults) are released as quickly as possible, even creating a new minor release outside the roadmap.

## Release Planning: Milestones

As mentioned above, several releases of the Re3gistry software are scheduled each year. The scheduled annual releases will be described in detail in the next sub-sections.

To inform users in advance about when the solution to each issue will be included in the release of the Re3gistry software, each issue is assigned to a specific milestone. Milestones are listed on [this page](https://github.com/ec-jrc/re3gistry/milestones). The release schedule of the Re3gistry software, which lists the expected release dates for each specific version, is available [here](https://github.com/ec-jrc/re3gistry/tree/management-draft/release-strategy). Once a new version of the Re3gistry software is released, the corresponding milestone is closed and moved to the list of closed milestones.
