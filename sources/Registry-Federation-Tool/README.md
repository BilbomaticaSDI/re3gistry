# Registry-Federation-Tool

The INSPIRE register federation is a distributed federation of registers related to the INSPIRE Directive.

The development of the INSPIRE Register Federation was undertaken by the JRC as part of ARE3NA, ISA Action 1.17
The European Commission is operating a (central) registry providing common INSPIRE registers, e.g. to manage INSPIRE code lists or themes. Where Member States extend these code lists, they are obliged to make available the extended values in local registers. Such local registers can also support other use cases, e.g. the management of organisations in a country that have to implement INSPIRE, or thematic vocabularies, such as those provided by EU institutions and bodies. 


The Register of Registers (RoR) is the central access point to the federation. It provides information about the registers included in the federation and the relationships between them, and allows searching for registers and the items contained in them. The RoR can be accessed using the RoR's graphical user interface or API, both of which are publicly accessible.
