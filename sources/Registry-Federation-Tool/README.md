# Register Federation Tool


The **Register Federation Tool**, previously known as "Register of Registers (RoR)", is an online platform providing a central access point to bring together or federate code lists or semantic asset registers. 

##Features:

- Intuitive harvesting control panel
- Data access via interface and REST API
- Configurable authentication system
- Search in federated registry contents
- Relationship tab
- Implements ROR specification for the representation of code list extensions

##Background:
The European Commission Joint Research Center developed the Register Federation Tool as a testbed funded by the ISA Action 1.17 "ARE3NA". Since then, the European Commission has operated the INSPIRE federated registry to publish extensions to the INSPIRE code lists used in national and thematic contexts. This favours flexibility and the satisfaction of specific needs, guaranteeing the general interoperability of the INSPIRE spatial data infrastructure.

##Known instances:
The [INSPIRE register federation](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/register-federation/) is a distributed federation of registers related to the INSPIRE Directive operated by the European Commission. Where Member States need to extend INSPIRE agreed on code lists, they must make available the extended values in local registers. Such local registers can also support other use cases, e.g. the management of organisations in a country that must implement INSPIRE or thematic vocabularies, such as those provided by EU institutions and bodies.
