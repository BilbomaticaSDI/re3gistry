    <description>The infrastructure involves a number of items, which require clear descriptions and the possibility to be referenced through unique identifiers. Examples for such items include themes, code lists, application schemas or discovery services. Registers provide a means to assign identifiers to items and their labels, definitions and descriptions (in different languages). The registry provides a central access point to a number of centrally managed registers. The content of these registers are based on the Directive, Implementing Rules and Technical Guidelines.</description>
