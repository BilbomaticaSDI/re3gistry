## About the Re3gistry

![Logo](documentation/images/logo.png)

The Re3gistry software is a reusable open-source solution for **managing and sharing ‘reference codes’** through persistent URIs, ensuring that concepts are unambiguously referenced in any domain.

> Reference codes can be sets of permissible values for a data field or to provide a reference or context for the data being exchanged between applications. Examples of reference codes are enumerations, controlled vocabularies, taxonomies, thesauri or, simply, ‘lists of things’.

Licensed under the **[EUPL](http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/eupl.html)**, Re3gistry is an open-source project that can be deployed and further developed by contributors from any sector, check out the Re3gistry Governance and contribution guidelines below.

## What Re3gistry offers you?

> The Re3gistry provides a central access point where labels and descriptions for reference codes are easily accessible by both humans and machines while fostering **semantic interoperability across organisations**.

Managing reference codes setting up registries (systems of registers) helps:

* **Avoiding common mistakes** such as misspellings, entering synonyms, or filling out online forms.
* **Facilitating the internationalisation of user interfaces** by providing multilingual labels.
* **Ensuring semantic interoperability** when exchanging data between systems and applications.
* **Tracing changes over time** throuhg a well documented versioning system.
* **Increasing the value of the reference codes**, if widely reused and referenced

## Acknowledgements

> The development of the Re3gistry began in 2013 under the [Are3na action](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/are3na/about) (ISA Programme), continuing since 2016 under the [ELISE action](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/elise-european-location-interoperability-solutions-e-government/about) of the [ISA2 Programme](https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/isa2_en/). Starting 2022, the **[Digital Europe Programme](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/digital-programme)** is funding its development.

Version 2 of the software was developed in cooperation with the [National Land Survey of Finland](https://www.maanmittauslaitos.fi/en).

# Re3gistry governance (Under development)

The governance structure and processes of the Re3gistry aim to ensure the use and sustainability of the Re3gistry by the community, and to keep it aligned to the community's needs.

The governance is ensured through the managers of the system.
